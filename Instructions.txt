Hello,

I have completed this chellenge using flask and mongodb.
i have created a one database.py python script file which content all the necesseary actions with the database
I have created a one more file name app.py which is the main application for running this files you should have mongodb with "filled" database name and "audio_files_record" collection name.
you should have python 3.6 or 3.6+ version
after that you have to install some requirement which is inside the requirements.txt file.

after that you have to run python3 or python app.py
